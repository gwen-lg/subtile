`subtile` is a Rust library which aims to propose a set of operations
for working on subtitles. Example: parsing from and export in different formats,
transform, adjust, correct, ...

## Project
### start
The project started with the fork of [`vobsub`](https://crates.io/crates/vobsub)
crate which no longer seems to be maintained.
Beyond the simple recovery, I want to take the opportunity to improve the code
and extend the provided features.

### Name
`Subtile` is a french word than fit well as contraction of `Subtitles Utils`.
